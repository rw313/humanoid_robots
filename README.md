part 2 link: https://youtu.be/5k7p997pQOIÂ  (I looked everywhere I could think of to solve the issue of the green arm not showing up or being draggable. Also I followed Piazza but restarting my machine and making sure that query goal path is checked did not have the green draggable arm show up. Doing a fresh reinstall also did not help)

part 4 links: I had to split recording the video into parts because my program kept crashing.
- Moving to table: https://youtu.be/uT8qcBGlMZg
- Getting grasps from GraspIt, uploading world to MoveIt, and requesting moveToArm in moveit_python, and picking up block: https://youtu.be/Awkmzz6cmf8
- Picking up block and placing block back on the table. Note--the drop would have put the block back in the same place but the gripper leaving the table still caused the longBox to topple: https://youtu.be/WUZTDb336J4 

Other things:
I used resources online from many different sources but couldn't find that many examples using moveit, graspit, etc. I also used fetch_api and the pick and place demo code already in the repo.
